## Motivations

Project introduction.
As part of a series of basic projects I'm taking a simple dataset and applying the general data science projecess, loading, wrangling, transformations and encoding, EDA, ML, and evaluations.
Goals:
- The dataset used by the project provides 33 features for 395 students.
    - amonsgt those features are values for the populations two schools as well as grades for third test.
- The goal will be to develop and train a model using features (X) excluding the the last test score so that student success on that test can be predicted using the other features.- 
Goals: Project Objectives
    Evaluation Metrics. (if the model can predict with 99% accuracy...)

## Methodologies
### Methods Employed
- Inferential Statistics
- Machine Learning
    - Why linear regression? The data lends itself to a straight-forward solution using this algorithm because the target and independent features are simple numeric values. This simpllicity allows me to focus more on the application of each data science step.
- Data Visualization
    - Although I primarily use Seaborn for visual analsys I also wanted to observe possible grouping beween more than 2 variables so during EDA I use plotly.express to generate 3D scatterplots.
- Predictive Modeling
- etc.
## Libraries and Technologies
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter, VSCde
